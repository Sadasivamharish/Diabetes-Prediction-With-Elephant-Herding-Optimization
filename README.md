My final year project is "Diabetes Mellitus prediction using Elephant Herding Optimization". 
The main purpose of my project is to predict the onset of diabetes in patients who are at the risk of developing it.
Using the HbA1c test result, we can implement this optimization algorithm to get the solution easily for very large datasets.
It can be used in hospital databases, pharmaceutical company databases to name a few implementations.
We have used an artificial neural network to implement the model. We have trained it with a database of 1000 entries.
